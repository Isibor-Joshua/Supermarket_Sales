# Supermarket_Sales
This project is about three supermarkets A, B and C located in three cities Yangon, Mandalay and Naypyitaw. 
The project involves an in-depth analysis of supermarket sales data to uncover key trends, patterns, and insights that can help improve sales strategies and optimize operations. By examining various aspects of the sales data, including customer demographics, purchase behavior, product performance, and seasonal trends, this analysis aims to provide actionable recommendations for enhancing supermarket profitability and customer satisfaction.
